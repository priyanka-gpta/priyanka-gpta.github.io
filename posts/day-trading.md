During the first two months after quitting, I had a lot of downtime. I was burnt out and needed space to understand my own headspace.

The first thing I tried was the stock market. It’s fascinating because both simple and complex strategies can yield results. 📈

I’d previously made good returns with my simple approach which worked for a long term view as I was bound by a holding period per the firm’s policy.

Now, it was time to tackle day trading, which I had never done and—heh—was a bit scared to try.

We had a model that provided ticker outcomes based on opening market prices so it was time to test it! 😁

I chose Zerodha, made five buy and sell orders, and my entire day from 9 AM to 3:30 PM disappeared in a blink. Mind you, I wasn’t trading non-stop but strategizing my exits. That is it. The rush was incredible!

This routine continued for 10 days, and I was profitable overall. I learned a lot and found it somewhat fun, but didn’t like how my entire mornings just disappeared. I was on a full-time break so I made a conscious choice to explore other interests.
