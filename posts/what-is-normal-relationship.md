Our most enduring relationship is the one we have with our parents, regardless of its length.

Before we get married, it’s (parents’) the only marriage we’re familiar with.

And no one ever discusses what marriage actually entails.

There are two ways to comprehend this:

1. You have done some introspection and have some understanding of yourself and decide that there are certain things you like/dislike and will/won’t look for in a partner.
2. Or, if you’re unaware, you’ll just accept everything you’ve learned from your parents and their relationship.

Humans instinctively react to challenges based on memory or experience.

When faced with a new challenge, we default to what we’ve seen before, seeking a sense of security.

→ If you’re aware, you’ll notice yourself drawing parallels in your relationship and make a decision at this point. This is not the default state and it’s caught in between. It’s a good place to start.

→ If you haven’t given marriage much thought, you’ll default to your parents’ norms. It could be good or bad. You’ll face the consequences.

When talking to people who have trouble understanding or maintaining relationships, I always encourage them to reflect on the relationship they know and the one they desire.

It’s not easy, but it becomes easier when you put in the effort to understand your needs and what you bring to the table.

Society’s definition of “normal” is an average. You can always have a variance.
