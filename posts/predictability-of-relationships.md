I have watched Silicon Valley twice.

The first attempt was in my naive era where I didn't think much about what was the joke/sarcasm and what is actually being communicated. The same happened with Ayn Rand books 😅

I watched it the second time this year and I was amazed when Richard broke up with his girlfriend over indentation as she wasn't saving "space" (she used Space instead of Tab). 🫢

Compliments to the chef on the argument mix. 👌
So beautifully they used this argument as a proxy for values, like how people argue over hair styles, tattoos, music choices, pizza toppings, dog vs cat ...
These deal breakers (are they?) signify predictability on how aligned will they be for scarier decisions.

The breakup in question here shows rigidity on Richard's part though and the show did signal that it was difficult for him to let go of his need for control, identity and certainty.

Second viewing was better for sure - more relatable (ecosystem and jokes) 😁
