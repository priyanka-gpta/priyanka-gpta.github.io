            <p>During the first two months after quitting, I had a lot of downtime. I was burnt out and needed space to understand my own headspace.</p>

            <p>The first thing I tried was the stock market. It’s fascinating because both simple and complex strategies can yield results. 📈</p>
                
            <p>I’d previously made good returns with my simple approach which worked for a long term view as I was bound by a holding period per the firm’s policy.</p>
                
            <p>Now, it was time to tackle day trading, which I had never done and -heh- was a bit scared to try.</p>
                
            <p>We had a model that provided ticker outcomes based on opening market prices so it was time to test it! 😁</p>
                
            <p>I chose Zerodha, made five buy and sell orders, and my entire day from 9 AM to 3:30 PM disappeared in a blink. Mind you, I wasn’t trading non-stop but strategizing my exits. That is it. The rush was incredible!</p>
                    
            <p>This routine continued for 10 days, and I was profitable overall. I learned a lot and found it somewhat fun, but didn’t like how my entire mornings just disappeared. I was on a full-time break so I made a conscious choice to explore other interests.</p>
