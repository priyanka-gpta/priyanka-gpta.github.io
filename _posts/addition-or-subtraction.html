            <p>Quite often, I ruin my painting by adding some feature or colour that was not required. Initially, I thought it was something to do with my painting skills that it just wasn't turning out to be good üòÅ </p>

            <p>While we all make such decisions as buying an expensive accessory for mobile/laptop or spending more for bundles/combos of hashtag#products, it is a psychological preference for addition vs subtraction by our brain.</p>
                
            </p>The University of Virginia studied this with a building exercise using hashtag#Lego. One of the interesting finds were that people preferred addition of lego bricks when they were under high cognitive load, had less time to consider their strategy and when the volunteers weren't reminded that subtraction was also an option. In the case of hashtag#startups, in order to meet their high-stress targets, they might end up with bloated teams. An alternate approach can be to optimise your current initiatives and resources.</p>
                
            <p>Daily considerations where I don't have subtraction in my thought process:</p>    
            <ol>
                <li>Stocks/Mutual Funds in my Investment Portfolio</li>
                <li>Grocery Cart</li>
                <li>Grocery Cart</li>
                <li>Painting Flower/Trees üòÅ [highlight of the painting - unnecessary addition as per me]</li>
            </ol>
                <p>What decisions have you made where you haven't thought of subtraction as a viable strategy?</p>
