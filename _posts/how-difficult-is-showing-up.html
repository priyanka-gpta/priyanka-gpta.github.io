            <p>Today is about the struggle of showing up.</p>

                <p>I was feeling unproductive, and then I ended up searching for productivity articles to learn what was new. I saw the same old stuff on routine, lists, tricking the mind, showing up. I wasn’t motivated still so I ended up writing about my inner dialogue.</p>
                
                <p>Do you have an inner dialogue that can totally steer the ship by building self doubt?</p>
                
                <p>That inner dialogue might not always be your friend.</p>
                
                <p>So really assess if you believe in that dialogue because it might not be true.</p>
                
                <p>What are these inner dialogues?</p>
                
                <p>These are your thoughts and beliefs that are quietly influencing your outcomes.</p>
                
                <p>The moment you put yourself in an out-of-comfort-zone situation, it is standing there with a worried look and arms folded, telling you something negative. Does that sound familiar?</p>
                
                <p>If not, you are doing good anyway.</p>
                
                <p>If yes, you can help yourself by doing this self-awareness check.</p>
                
                <p>Sit down next weekend and think about an activity that you would normally wouldn’t engage in. Try to notice what kind of dialogues are flowing in.</p>
                
                <p>Do they make sense?</p>
                
                <p>You have done things before that made you nervous but it worked out in the end.</p>
                
                <p>Keep a note of this.</p>
                
                <p>Do this exercise over the next few days and you will see a pattern.</p>
                
                <p>Now, you are aware of what kind of dialogues pop up. When you are out there on your own and similar thoughts kick in, you know that these do not belong there.</p>
                
                <p>The change in your inner dialogues will come over a period of time with positive reinforcements.</p>
                
                <p>But it is up to you to SNIP at the moment and SNAP out of it!</p>
