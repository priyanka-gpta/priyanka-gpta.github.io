            <p>To people who are wanting to quit their jobs to start a business:</p>

            <p>It has been 9 months since I put my resignation. My perception of how things would unfold was so far away from reality.</p>
            <p>Am I regretting leaving a comfortable job? No.</p>
                
            <p>There is no other way for me to experience this.</p>
                
            <p>Reality check?</p>
                
            <p>I never worked in a startup before but my desire for problem solving, action, results and sustainable solutions was my driving force. Each day, I push myself to learn and do things completely out of my comfort zone. Sounds fun, doesn’t it? It is the most difficult thing I have had to do.</p>
                
            <p>Yes, I can make time during the day. I like my after meal walks but the day doesn’t really end. It spills over and you learn to make a boundary.</p>
                
            <p>There are days when you don’t get enough engagement or calls and it gets tough to stick to the plan because the plan isn’t applicable anymore. You adapt.</p>
                
            <p>Here comes the need for a support system, and in my case, it is my partner. But that support system can only be there up to a certain point. You build resilience.</p>
                
            <p>I had those fears as well: money, people, failure… here is some gyaan if you are looking for it.</p>
                
            <ol>
                <li>How will I manage money?</li>

                <p>Calculate your net worth and account for rental, food, clothes, travel and gadgets. Add a good buffer. If you are unprepared and your salary stops flowing in after 2 months, it will pinch with magnitude.</p>
                
                <li>What will people say?</li>
                <p>The journey is lonely. You will have your network helping you, but most of the time, you are the only one who has to fight your self-doubt and stick to your beliefs. People will tell you daily how your idea will fail or not scale. They may be right… but at least attempt, experiment, sell and then decide if it is worth your time. People might not get it why it is what you do.</p>
                
                <li>What if I fail?</li>
                <p>90% of startups fail. That doesn’t speak about your failure. You are solving a problem. Many external factors are at play: marketing, market readiness, funds, network, competition etc. Keep your ego aside and get back to a job till you find yourself ready again or not. If you are worried about what people will say, they only say, but you do it for yourself.</p>
            </ol>
                <p>I have a lot to learn and there is no shortcut, so here we are. :)</p>
