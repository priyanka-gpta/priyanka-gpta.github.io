            <p>Our most enduring relationship is the one we have with our parents, regardless of its length.</p>

            <p>Before we get married, it’s (parents’) the only marriage we’re familiar with.</p>
                
            <p>And no one ever discusses what marriage actually entails.</p>
                
            <p>There are two ways to comprehend this:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>You have done some introspection and have some understanding of yourself and decide that there are certain things you like/dislike and will/won’t look for in a partner.</li>
                <li>Or, if you’re unaware, you’ll just accept everything you’ve learned from your parents and their relationship.</li>
            </ol>
                
            <p>Humans instinctively react to challenges based on memory or experience.</p>
                
            <p>When faced with a new challenge, we default to what we’ve seen before, seeking a sense of security.</p>
                
            <p>→ If you’re aware, you’ll notice yourself drawing parallels in your relationship and make a decision at this point. This is not the default state and it’s caught in between. It’s a good place to start.</p>
            <p>→ If you haven’t given marriage much thought, you’ll default to your parents’ norms. It could be good or bad. You’ll face the consequences.</p>
                
            <p>When talking to people who have trouble understanding or maintaining relationships, I always encourage them to reflect on the relationship they know and the one they desire.</p>
                
            <p>It’s not easy, but it becomes easier when you put in the effort to understand your needs and what you bring to the table.</p>
                
            <p>Society’s definition of “normal” is an average. You can always have a variance.</p>
